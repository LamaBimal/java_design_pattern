### Composite Design Pattern
- Structural Design Pattern
- Allows you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

**Components**

**Component**: An interface or abstract class for all objects in the composition, both composite and leaf nodes.
**Leaf**: Represents individual objects in the composition that do not have any children.
**Composite**: Represents a node that can have children, typically implementing the child-related operations in the 
component interface.
