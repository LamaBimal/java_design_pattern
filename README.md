## Java Design Pattern

 Design Patterns is a set of solutions to common problems we encounter in software design and development. They were first introduced in the book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software, published in 1994. The book was written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, who are collectively known as Gang of Four.

 There are 3 categories for design patterns.
 1. Creational
 2. Behavioral
 3. Structural

### Creational Design Pattern

Creational Design Patterns focus on the process of object creation in software development. These patterns make sure that we create things in a way thatâ€™s not only easy but also flexible, so we can change them later if we need too. They hide the complicated details of how we put pieces together.

1. Singleton
2. Factory Design Pattern
3. Prototype Design Pattern
4. Builder Design Pattern
