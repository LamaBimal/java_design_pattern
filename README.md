## Java Design Pattern

 Design Patterns is a set of solutions to common problems we encounter in software design and development. They were first introduced in the book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software, published in 1994. The book was written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, who are collectively known as Gang of Four.

 There are 3 categories for design patterns.
 1. Creational
 2. Behavioral
 3. Structural

### Creational Design Pattern

Creational Design Patterns focus on the process of object creation in software development. These patterns make sure that we create things in a way thatâ€™s not only easy but also flexible, so we can change them later if we need too. They hide the complicated details of how we put pieces together.

1. Singleton :
    
2. Factory Design Pattern :

3. Prototype Design Pattern :

4. Builder Design Pattern :
   The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of complex objects 
   from their representation, offering a cleaner and more flexible approach to object creation.

5. Abstract Factory Pattern:
   Abstract Factory design pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
   It is useful when a  system needs to be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

   Key Components
   - Abstract Factory: Declares methods for creating abstract products.
   - Concrete Factory: Implements the creation methods defined in the abstract factory.
   - Abstract Product: Declares an interface for a type of product object.
   - Concrete Product: Implements the interface defined by the abstract product.
   - Client: Uses only the interfaces defined by the abstract factory and abstract product.
